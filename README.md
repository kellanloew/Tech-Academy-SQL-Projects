# Tech-Academy-SQL-Projects

As part of the SQL course at the Tech Academy, I had to write several SQL queries in increasing level of difficulty, and then make them stored procedures.  The database represented a library branch system, where each branch had a certain number of books, borrowers, and books borrowed.
First I wrote a SQL script that created tables and populated them with sample data. Once I ensured the tables were created correctly, I wrote the queries.
